						<h2>Ship Pal Gae</h2>
						<p>Ship Pal Gae means 18 Weapons. Though there are hundreds of Chinese weapons, Ship Pal Gae 
						incorporates the main 18 Chinese weapons. The principles learned from the practice of these 
						18 weapons will give the practitioner the foundation of understanding to be able perform 
						the movements of all the Chinese weapons.</p>

						<p>In the beginning students learn weaponless movements necessary to develop the strength, 
						coordination concentration, timing and internal development necessary to be able to practice 
						with real weapons without accident or injury. Next the student learns short series of movements 
						with the weapon to learn basic control, timing and understanding of how to move the body with 
						the weapon. Once a basic foundation is developed then the student begins to learn longer forms 
						and advanced movements to develop higher levels of internal and external health.</p>

						<p>Ship Pal Gae movements and forms develop all organs, ligaments, joints, muscles, respiratory, 
						nervous and circulatory systems. This increases Qi, strength, flexibility, and improves 
						reflexes, coordination and timing. Mentally, the mind becomes calm and develops an increased 
						level of self awareness as well as an enhanced ability to focus and concentrate. The mental and 
						physical (internal and external) development that is reached through weapons training is many 
						times that which can be achieved by practicing main forms and weaponless movements alone.</p>
