						<h2>Kom Do</h2>
						<p>Kom Do means the way of the Sword. Beginning level practice begins with the 
						bamboo version called the Kom Do Chea. Kom Do Chea training is
						necessary to prepare the practitioner mentally and physically 
						before he can learn the movements that teach him the way of 
						the sword. Once a foundation is developed then the practitioner 
						moves on to wooden sword known as the Kom Do Muk. Kom Do Muk 
						training teaches the student the way of the bladed sword known 
						as the Kom Do.</p>

						<p>Long ago the Kom Do was carried by class of person know as the Samurai. The Samurai were respected 
						for their strict code of integrity, honesty and morality. The Ruling class at the time relied 
						on the Samurai's wisdom and physical ability to help lead the country. The Samurai relied on 
						their practice to give them the mental and physical sharpness and strength necessary to 
						successfully apply their knowledge and wisdom.</p>
