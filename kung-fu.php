						<h2>Kung Fu</h2>
						<p>Goong means palace and Fu means out of. Literally, the martial art study from the palace. 
						The movements practiced are based on the natural movements of animals and nature. Long ago high 
						level practitioners and scholars carefully studied the motions of animals and observed the 
						relationship between the unlimited mobility of their movements and the prevention of sickness 
						and disease. Centuries of research concluded that wild animals, through their ability to move 
						naturally, gracefully, and without limitations, seldom get sick. The movements of the animals 
						were copied fitting them to the way the human body moves. Other movements from nature were 
						also copied to fit by the human body such as air currents, ocean waves and mountains. The uses 
						of special herbs were also applied to enhance further development.</p>

						<p>Through many generations adjustments to the forms were necessary to fine tune these movements 
						to maximize the health benefits to the human body. Centuries of research and observation resulted in 
						Moo Doe main forms practiced for internal and external strength and development.</p>

						<p>In the beginning, students practice short series of movements known as short forms to 
						develop and prepare themselves to learn the main internal forms. The practice of the short 
						forms is not just for development but is necessary to understand the control, timing and the 
						way the body needs to move to fit by the form. Next, students begin to practice longer series 
						of higher level movements called Hyung or main forms. The internal and external benefits of 
						main hyung practice are limitless. The practice of these forms allows the practitioner to 
						balance and distribute the Qi throughout the organs and all areas of the body.</p>

						<p>Each Main form develops the body differently, increasing the amount of blood circulation 
						by opening and strengthening the blood vessels. Improving the respiratory system by allowing 
						the body to absorb oxygen more efficiently, accelerating metabolism helping digestion and the 
						removal of toxins from the body. Main form movement increases the range of the body's motion 
						and develops elasticity, strength and flexibility in muscles, joints, ligaments, tendons, vertebrae, 
						and the spinal cord. This improves the efficiency of the internal organs, nervous system and 
						releases negative stress. Main Hyung training engages the mind to learn balance, increases focus, 
						concentration and self awareness and improves patience, confidence and mental calmness.</p>
