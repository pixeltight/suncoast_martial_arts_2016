						<h2>Tai Chi</h2>
						<p><img src="assets/img/tai-chi.jpg" id="tai-chi" alt="tai chi image" title="tai chi image">Tai Chi Chung is a basic form of Chinese exercise intended to improve one's health and build 
						muscle tone. Movements are practiced slowly without force or power. Proper breathing along with 
						the correct body movement is important in gaining the benefits of Tai Chi training. The 
						beginning movements of Tai Chi are basic and are relatively simple to perform. This training is 
						ideal for the beginner of any age as an introduction to higher level Moo Doe movements and forms.</p>

						<p>Tai Chi practice with Qi Gong breathing improves one's health by improving the 
						respiratory and circulatory systems, basic joint and muscle flexibility and overall muscle 
						tone. Tai Chi practice increases Qi (energy) in the internal organs and helps to release stress 
						which tends to accrue in daily life. Once a certain level is obtained the practitioner then can 
						learn to move energy to different parts of the body through the different positions and 
						movements. This energy will help heal and strengthen the body, calm the mind and increase one&apos;s 
						health. The practice of Tai Chi also will physically improve one&apos;s balance and coordination. 
						A recent study of Tai Chi has show it is also effective in easing arthritis pain. (See links on left for more information 
						on the health benefits of Tai Chi) Tai Chi is the beginning level of movement of the internal arts 
						taught at Suncoast Martial Arts.</p>
