						<h2>Our philosophy</h2>
						<p>8 styles of Martial Arts are taught to our students. The benefit of our teaching
						 isn’t solely the practice of self-defense or combat; our training goals are 
						 the physical benefits of flexibility, strength, mobility, health, longevity 
						 and ultimately the “mind-body” connection. The beauty of our method is students 
						 of all ages and backgrounds can achieve their personal fitness goals with success. 
						 The 8 styles are as follows:</p>

						<p><a href="kong-su.php" title="kong su">Kong Su</a> movements are linear in nature 
						and consist of both offensive and defensive movements using the hands, feet 
						and elbows. These techniques can be applied in self defense situations with 
						minimal practice. <a href="kong-su.php" title="kong su">Read more...</a>

						<p><a href="bagwa-chung.php" title="bagwa chung">Bagwa Chung</a> training develops strength and 
						flexibility in the joints, tendons, ligaments, muscles, and all internal organs. 
						Through the correct practice of Bagwa Chung the practitioner will be able to 
						develop the natural power within, as well as overall health and an advanced level 
						of self defense ability. <a href="bagwa-chung.php" title="bagwa chung">Read more...</a></p>

						<p><a href="kung-fu.php" title="kung fu">Kung Fu</a> movements practiced are based on the natural 
						movements of animals and nature. Centuries of research concluded that wild 
						animals, through their ability to move naturally, gracefully, and without 
						limitations, seldom get sick. <a href="kung-fu.php" title="kung fu">Read more...</a></p>

						<p><a href="udo-ju-jitsu.php" title="udo &#38; ju-jitsu">Udo &#38; Ju-Jitsu</a> both mean soft or flexible 
						way. The movements practiced in Udo and Ju Jitsu combine falls, rolls, flips, 
						sweeps, throws, take downs along with punching, kicking and joint manipulation. 
						<a href="udo-ju-jitsu.php" title="udo &#38; ju-jitsu">Read more...</a></p>

						<p><a href="tai-chi.php" title="tai-chi">Tai Chi</a> is a basic form of Chinese exercise 
						intended to improve one's health and build muscle tone. Movements are practiced 
						slowly without force or power. Tai Chi practice increases Qi (energy) in the 
						internal organs and helps to release stress which tends to accrue in daily life.

						<p><a href="hap-ki-do.php" title="hap ki do &#38; ai ki do">Hap Ki Do &#38; Ai Ki Do</a> 
						are styles of self defense used in medium and close range situations. The 
						practitioner uses the assailant's energy or power against him, and learns to 
						blend and adapt to the attacker's movements. The movements consist of attacking 
						the joints using joint locking techniques, throws, take downs, sweeps, kicking 
						and punching. <a href="hap-ki-do.php" title="hap ki do &#38; ai ki do">Read more...</a></p>

						<p><a href="kom-do.php" title="kom do">Kom Do</a> means the way of the Sword. Long ago the 
						Kom Do was carried by class of person know as the Samurai. The Samurai were respected for 
						their strict code of integrity, honesty and morality. <a href="kom-do.php" title="kom do">

						<p><a href="ship-pal-gae.php" title="ship pal gae">Ship Pal Gae</a> means 18 
						Chinese weapons. Ship Pal Gae movements and forms develop all organs, 
						ligaments, joints, muscles, respiratory, nervous and circulatorysystems. 
						The principles learned from the practice of these weapons will give the practitioner 
						the foundation of understanding to be able perform the movements of all the 
						Chinese weapons. <a href="ship-pal-gae.php" title="ship pal gae">Read more...</a></p>
