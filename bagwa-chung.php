						<h2>Bagwa Chung</h2>
						<p><img src="assets/img/bagwa-chung.jpg" id="bagwa-chung" alt="bagwa-chung-image" title="bagwa-chung image">Through the correct practice of Bagwa Chung the practitioner will be able to 
						develop the natural power within, as well as overall health and an advanced level 
						of self defense ability. The practitioner learns to use his whole body in every 
						movement. The body moves as light as feather but with a strength of a bear. By 
						practicing the spiral and circular movements in Bagwa Chung, the body movements 
						are flexible, resilient and elastic in nature with the ability to release strength
						or energy at any given moment.</p>

						<p>One of the many forms taught in Bagwa Chung is Bagwa walk. The practitioner walks 
						in a circle holding various positions and executing changes in direction through 
						short series of movements. Proper breathing is important in the development of 
						internal strength and must be coordinated with the movements.</a>

						<p>Bagwa Chung training develops strength and flexibility in the joints, tendons, 
						ligaments, muscles, and all internal organs. The respiratory, nervous, circulatory systems 
						will function more efficiently. Bagwa Chung practice increases flexibility and strength 
						in the spine, hips and properly aligns the skeletal structure. It improves mental clarity, 
						increases self awareness, concentration and enhances the ability to focus. Practitioners 
						develop a calm and relaxed mind and an increased level of mind and body unity. Bagwa 
						Chung practice increases the flow of Qi through the acupuncture meridians to allow the body 
						to heal and energize itself in order to reach its ultimate level of mental and 
						physical health and harmony.</p>

						<p>In the application of self defense Bagwa Chung movements allows the practitioner to 
						be adaptable and evasive. The ability to cut in, spin out and redirect blows or energy is 
						ideal for defending oneself against a skilled linear attacker as well as multiple attackers 
						coming from any direction.</p>

						<p>Bagwa Chung training is based on the principles of Ying Yang (Chinese) or Oom 
						Yung (Korean) and is one of the highest forms of internal development taught at 
						this level.</p>
