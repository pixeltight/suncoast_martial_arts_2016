						<h2>Hap Ki Do &#38; Ai Ki Do</h2>
						<p>Hap Ki Do and Ai Ki Do are styles of self defense used in medium and close range 
						situations. The practitioner uses the assailant's energy or power against him, and 
						learns to blend and adapt to the attacker's movements. The movements consist of 
						attacking the joints using joint locking techniques, throws, take downs, sweeps, 
						kicking and punching. Using both soft and hard style movements, practitioners 
						learn to attack towards vital areas and acupressure points for quick, effective 
						results with the least amount of effort exerted.</p>

						<p>Students practice these movements not only for self defense, but also to 
						develop timing, coordination, control, dexterity, joint flexibility, mental 
						sharpness and self confidence. In the beginning, in order to develop a solid 
						foundation, students practice the movements slowly and carefully learning how to 
						use the body and the self defense movements to their maximum efficiency. Later, 
						the student moves on to practice a series of connected movements with one or more 
						partners, not only to improve the mind and body, but to enhance self defense 
						capabilities against one or more assailants. At Suncoast Martial Arts, students learn to 
						defend against attackers with weapons as well as empty hand attacks.</a>
